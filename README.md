# Applied Cryptography in the Cloud Security

## 📘 Project Overview
This repository contains a project for **Applied Cryptography in the Cloud**.
The project is based on a case study of **Cyber Guard Solutions Pvt Ltd**, focusing on securing
financial and healthcare data using modern cryptographic techniques.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Demonstrate encryption and decryption using PKI
- Analyse and mitigate Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks
- Design secure communication using TLS and VPN technologies
- Implement VPN security using OpenVPN
- Assess risks and challenges of cloud-hosted PKI

## 🔐 Cryptographic Technologies Used
- Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
- Public Key Encryption (PKE)
- Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEM)
- Data Encapsulation Mechanisms (DEM)
- AES-GCM and ChaCha20-Poly1305
- TLS / Mutual TLS (mTLS)
- OpenVPN (IPsec & SSL VPN concepts)

## 🏢 Business Case Context
